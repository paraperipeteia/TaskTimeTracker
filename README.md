#Task time tracker 

A simple little tracker for tasks made into a browser extension for Chrome-based browsers. 
<br>
Simple, yet functional.

<br>
##Improvements to be done: 
<ol>
<li>1. Save out the tasks on a refresh so they don't disappear.</li>
<li>2. Update the save/load logic to use a user-specified file rather than local storage.</li>
<li>3. DONE - Add start date data to task (Unix timestamp).</li>
<li>4. (Maybe someday) Get it up on the Chrome Web Store merely as a sharing convenience.</li>
</ol>
